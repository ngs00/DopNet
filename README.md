# DopNet
A neural network to predict materials properties from chemical formulas of doped materials. This machine learning method was evaluated in predicting thermoelectric properties of the doped materials. Detailed information and the evaluation results are published at [doi].

# Run
A python file named "exec_train.py" should be executed to get a trained DopNet for your training dataset. An example dataset is provided in the dataset folder.
